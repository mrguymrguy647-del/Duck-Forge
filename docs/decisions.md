# Design decisions

This file explains, in plain language, the choices made while teaching
duckforge to run games without a screen, and why. Each step of that work
has its own section, oldest first.

## Step 1: The same inputs always give the same game

The goal: if you play a game twice with the same inputs, you get exactly
the same game, down to the last pixel. Replays, automatic tests and an AI
checking its own work all depend on this.

**A fixed timestep is now the default: 60 updates per second.** Before,
`update()` got `dt` = however long the last frame really took. Frame times
wobble a little, so the ball took slightly different steps on every run,
and differently again on a faster computer. Now every update moves the
game forward exactly 1/60 of a second. If the computer can only draw 30
frames a second, the loop runs two updates before each frame, so the game
keeps its speed. On a 120 Hz screen, every other frame gets no update.
`Config::timestep` chooses: `Timestep::Fixed { updates_per_second }` or
`Timestep::RealTime`, which is the old behaviour.

**The stress test keeps real time.** It measures frames per second by
counting updates. With a fixed timestep, updates and drawn frames are no
longer the same thing, so it asks for `Timestep::RealTime`.

**Frames a little early or late still get exactly one update.** Real
frames are never exactly 1/60 s apart. A simple fixed-timestep loop gives
one frame 0 updates and the next 2 when a frame is slightly early, and
that looks like a stutter. The loop's `Pacer` keeps the leftover time
halfway between two updates, so a frame can be up to 8 ms early or late
and still get one update.

**After a long freeze, the game slows down instead of catching up.** If a
frame took more than 0.1 s (the window was dragged, or the computer is too
slow), the missing time is dropped. Catching up would mean running dozens
of updates in a row, which makes the next frame even later.

**A seed in `Config`.** `seed: Some(n)` makes `ctx.rng` give the same
numbers on every run. With `None`, a game in a window gets a seed from the
clock, as before, so every game is different.

**`Simulation`: one core for windows, tests and headless runs.** Instead
of writing a second game loop for tests, the game now always runs inside a
`Simulation`, which knows nothing about windows or clocks: you press keys
and call `step()`. The window's loop is a thin layer around it that adds
the clock and the screen. A game can't behave differently in a test than
it does on screen, because it's the same code.

**A `Simulation` with no seed uses seed 1, not the clock.** In a window,
a new seed each time keeps the game fresh for the player. In a test there
is no player, and a test that gives a different answer each time it runs
is worse than useless. So a `Simulation` is repeatable unless you ask for
something else.

**Drawing only when a picture is needed.** `Simulation` calls the game's
`draw()` only when you ask for `picture()`. That's safe because `draw()`
takes `&self` and can't change the game, and it makes long test runs much
faster.

**A `Simulation` always draws 3D on the CPU.** Graphics cards from
different makers can differ by a pixel here and there, and a cloud machine
usually has no graphics card at all. The CPU renderer gives the same
picture everywhere.

**F3 and F12 are read straight from the keyboard.** They used to be checked
through the game's input after each update. With a fixed timestep a drawn
frame can have zero updates (or two), so the window now checks them once
per drawn frame itself. Games still see these keys too, as before.

**A bug found on the way: nearby seeds gave nearly the same game.** The
first test played Breakout with seed 7 and with seed 8, expecting
different games, and got identical pictures. The random number generator
(xorshift) starts badly from small seeds: its first numbers from seeds 7
and 8 are both about 0.0004, so the ball was served at almost the same
angle. `Rng::new` now scrambles the seed first, and a test checks that
seeds 1 to 1000 give first numbers spread over the whole range. Side
effect: the stress test's random layout changed a little, so the triangle
counts in the README's benchmark table changed by less than 2%. The FPS
figures there were measured with the old layout and were left as they are.

**What "the same" covers.** Same game, same inputs, same seed, same
computer and build: identical. On a different operating system, maths
functions like `sin` can round the last bit differently, so a long game
can slowly drift. A game also stops being repeatable if it makes decisions
with its own clock (`std::time::Instant`) or with the order of items in a
`HashMap`. Use `ctx.dt()`, `ctx.time()` and `ctx.rng` instead.
